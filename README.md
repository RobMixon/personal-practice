Personal project to learn, utilize and practice code. 
Starting out with CSS and HTML.
Will add java as we progress. 

Looking to build a basic castle defense game where you can upgrade your castle to defend against oncoming and ever more persistent enemies. Might include a road or basic travel path for enemies.
